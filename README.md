The .ijm file contained here can be downloaded and opened with the ImageJ/Fiji software for image analysis. The program will ask the user for a directory and must be provided a folder of images with no files other than the images intended for the analysis inside of it. This program was intended for ImageJ version 1.54p and may work with later iterations of Java. The output of this program is a text file contain comma separated variables. It is reccommended that the file be saved with a .csv extension, but this extension does need to be added manually. The file will not save automatically, nor will the .csv extension be added automatically. If the program does not detect any cells in an image, it may crash before finishing the analysis or the rest of the directory. If this happens, the image crashing the program should be removed from the directory.
